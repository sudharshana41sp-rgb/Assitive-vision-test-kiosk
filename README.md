Assistive Keystroke Vision Test (8051 + Python + PyGame)

This project demonstrates how embedded systems can be used in healthcare applications, specifically for vision testing. It integrates an 8051 microcontroller simulation with Python applications to provide virtual eye tests like cataract, glare, and low-contrast vision checks.

üîÑ Working Principle

User Interaction

A 4x3 Keypad is connected to the 8051.

Pressing keys:

1 ‚Üí Cataract Test

2 ‚Üí Glare Test

3 ‚Üí Low Contrast Test

LCD Feedback

The 16x2 LCD shows a ‚Äúloading‚Äù message while the test is being prepared.

Serial Communication

The 8051 is connected to a virtual COM port in Proteus.

Using UART (TX/RX), the microcontroller sends the test selection to the PC.

Python Application (PySerial + PyGame)

PySerial listens to the COM port.

Based on the key pressed, PyGame displays the correct vision test chart.

Result Output

After test completion, the system evaluates performance.

Displays Snellen ratio + remark about vision quality.
